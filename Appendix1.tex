\subsection{Survey Title}
Topic Labelling Survey-A
\subsection{Survey Description}
We are studying algorithms to generate a global label for a bag of words representing a topic discussed in a forum.
To help us in this study, we invite you to participate to this topic labelling survey.
Each question below refers to one bag of words from a real forum topic (e.g. Topic 1 - Bag of words: "css, html, firefox, ie, internet-explorer, browser, xhtml, web-development, div, layout") and several options for a possible label for that topic (e.g. html, firefox,web-development, css, browser")
Please choose one option which can represent the best label for that topic.
If you find none of the proposed labels is adequate (i.e. if the labels do not well describe the topic in your opinion), please specify your own label using the "Other" label field.
Thank you very much for your participation.
